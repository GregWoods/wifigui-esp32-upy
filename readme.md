# Getting Started

The development process is based on this blog post: https://lemariva.com/blog/2019/08/micropython-vsc-ide-intellisense

It uses micropy-cli and PyMaker (VS Code extension)



## My naming Conventions

my folder structure for local dev:

~/microcontroller-home/wifigui-esp32-upx


the "-home" suffix indicates there will be a lot more stuff inside
the project naming follows the format
shortName-platform-language
